			First of all I am going to give you a little description about me. My name is Jose and I am from Cartagena, Colombia. I am an 18 years old man who
			always dreamed of being a professional football player, especifically a goalkeeper, I think I have developed a strong personality thanks to this sport
			and especially this position, not only talking about football I have always been a serious and <strong>determined</strong> person who knows what he wants. I finished
			school in november 2023 with a 3.07 GPA and wanted to study in the U.S.A as a student-athlete but unfortunately it was still too expensive even though
			I won a $18,600 scholarship. Now I started with this project while I get ready to study in Germany, hope I can learn and be ready to take a job as soon
			as possible because I think it is time to buy my own things, help with some money in my home and save money for achieving my goals and dreams.
