	<h1>Hey, this is in fact, my first serious project. I'm trying to get a certification with coursera and I think this is going to be a good start</h1>
	<h3>I'm just grabbing experience at the moment.</h3>
	<p><strong>Here are some things I want to develop at the same time I keep learning in this course:</strong></p>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Programming logic</li>
		<li>Adapt to any work environment
			<ul>
				<li>Team work</li>
				<li>Working on other people's programs</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Organization</li>
		<li>Self-awareness</li>
		<li>Discipline</li>
	</ul>
</div>
	<p><strong>Now I will tell you what I already know and what are some projects that I have in mind.</strong></p>
<div>
	<ol>
		<li>I already took a free JavaScript course on YouTube</li>
		<li>I am taking this web development course in coursera because now I understand lots of concepts
			<ul>
				<li>Add it to my CV</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>I am going to do a functional calculator or something similar as I get used to coding
			<ul>
				<li>Add it to my portfolio</li>
				<li>That will count as practice too</li>
